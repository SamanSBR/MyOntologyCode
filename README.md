# MyOntologyCode
	A conceptual open-source project to explore how the world — or our understanding of it — can be modeled using Object-Oriented Programming.
	
	This is not a productivity tool. It's a philosophical framework.  
	We simulate not reality, but our ways of thinking about reality.
	
	Let there be classes.  
	Let there be abstraction.  
	Let there be a constructor for awe.
 

## What is MyOntologyCode?

    MOC is an open-source tool that lets you define philosophical concepts and their relations using code(OOP). 

    Start with your own ideas, share them  and invite others to contribute their perspectives.

## Core Concepts

- `Zaat` – The abstract root of all beings. Never instantiated. A conceptual essence.
- `Human` – A composed class with injected `Identity`, `Experience`, and `Emotion`.
- `Emotion` – Not a value. A behavior.
- `Experience` – Contextual timeline of the entity's memory.

## Tips

  ### Play, Don’t Win (اسرار ازل را نه تو دانی و نه من)

    This project is not about winning. It’s about playing and thinking. We don’t know if reality is real or just a game.

    MOC is not a program or a tool yet . It’s just a way to think about the world and how we understand it.

    We don’t give answers. We help you ask better questions.

  ### Zaat: The Start of Everything 

    **Zaat** means essence, it is the main idea in MyOntologyCode. 

    Everything in this project starts with Zaat and inherit from Zaat,like object class in Js.

    This is not about God or religion. It’s about creating ideas and seeing what happens.

### Connections, Not Things

    In MOC,for simplicity now we just care about how things connect, not just what they are.

    Things like Time, Identity, and Emotion are not simple facts.

    They are ideas that work together.

    A person (**Human**) is not just a name or a body. it have **Identity**, **Experience** , and **Emotion** .

    Emotions change and move like actions, not like numbers.

### Code as Thinking 

    Why use code? Because code makes ideas clear. When you write code, you show your choices. 

    Ideas in your head can be hard to explain, but code makes them real.(OOP)

    MOC doesn’t say it’s right. It says it knows what it’s trying to do.

### You Are Part of It

    MyOntologyCode is not for work—it’s for thinking. You can change it, add to it, or say Zaat is not a good idea and make your own.

    That’s why this project exists.


### Behind the Mystery (چون پرده یر افتد نه تو مانی و نه من)

    Maybe we will never know what reality is. But MOC is our way to keep thinking and creating, even if we don’t understand everything.

    Let’s make ideas. Let’s dream. Let’s build something amazing.



#### How to Start

    MyOntologyCode is an idea, not a finished program. Here’s how to use it:
    **Read**: Look at the ideas in this file and my code.
    **Think**: Ask if Zaat, Human, or other ideas make sense to you (OOP).
    **Dream**: Use this to think about the world in your way or a famous philosopher.
    **Change**: Add your own ideas or make new ones.
