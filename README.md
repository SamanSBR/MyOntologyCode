# MyOntologyCode

*A conceptual open-source project to explore how the world — or our understanding of it — can be modeled using Object-Oriented Programming.*

> This is not a productivity tool. It’s a philosophical framework.  
> We simulate not reality, but our ways of thinking about reality.

Let there be classes.  
Let there be abstraction.  
Let there be a constructor for awe.

## What is MyOntologyCode?

**MyOntologyCode (MOC)** is an open-source framework that lets you define philosophical concepts and their relationships using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Start with your own ideas, share them, and invite others to contribute their perspectives.

---

## Some Concepts

- **Zaat** – The abstract root of all beings. Never instantiated. A conceptual essence.
- **Human** – A composed class with injected Identity, Experience, and Emotion.
- **Emotion** – Not a value. A behavior.
- **Experience** – A contextual timeline of the entity’s memory.

## Tips

### 🎭 Play, Don’t Win *(اسرار ازل را نه تو دانی و نه من)*

This project is not about winning. It’s about playing, thinking, and wondering.  
We don’t know if reality is real — or just a game.

MOC is not a tool. It’s a way of seeing.  
We don’t give answers. We help you ask better questions.

---

### 🧬 Zaat: The Start of Everything

**Zaat** means *essence*.  
It’s the root of all things in MOC, like `Object` in JavaScript or other base classes.

Everything begins with Zaat and inherits from it.

> This is not about God or religion. It’s about crafting ideas and watching them unfold.

🧠 **A way to think about it**:  
- **Zaat** is like **ROM** — unchanging, permanent, beyond immediate memory.  
- **Existence** is like **RAM** — temporary, occupying memory only while active.

> If something takes up space in memory — it *exists*.  
> But not everything that exists has a **Zaat**.  
> And not all Zaat needs to be loaded to exist.

---

### 🔗 Connections, Not Things

In MOC, we care more about **how things connect** than what they are.

Time, Identity, and Emotion are not static facts.  
They’re active concepts that interact.

A **Human** is not just a body or a name — it’s a container of:  
- **Identity**  
- **Experience**  
- **Emotion**

Emotions move and behave. They don’t sit still like numbers.

---

### 🧠 Code as Thinking

Why code?

Because code makes ideas precise.  
It forces clarity. It exposes assumptions.

Ideas in your head are vague.  
Code makes them real — and testable.

MOC doesn’t claim to be *right*. It claims to be *intentional*.

---

### 🫂 You Are Part of It

MOC is not a product. It’s a playground for thought.

Change it. Extend it. Or reject it completely and build your own “ontology.”

That’s the point.

---

### 🌌 Behind the Mystery *(چون پرده بر افتد نه تو مانی و نه من)*

Maybe we’ll never understand reality.  
But MOC is our way of thinking, dreaming, and building — anyway.

Let’s make ideas.  
Let’s dream.  
Let’s build something amazing.

## 💾 Zaat vs. Existence — A Final Reflection

Here’s a way to code the mystery:

```python
class Zaat:
    pass  # Pure essence. It defines meaning, not presence.

class Idea(Zaat):
    pass  # It has essence, but may never be loaded into existence.

class Dust:
    def __init__(self):
        self.exists = True  # It takes up memory, but means nothing.

# Example 1: Something with Zaat, but no existence
philosopher_king = Idea()  # has Zaat, but never instantiated in the world

# Example 2: Something with existence, but no Zaat
random_bits = Dust()  # exists in memory, but has no deeper meaning

# Final reflection:
print("Zaat defines meaning. Existence just loads memory.")
```
---

### In MOC:  
- Something **can have Zaat but not exist** (like a pure concept).  
- Something **can exist but have no Zaat** (like meaningless noise in RAM).

> Existence fills memory.  
> Zaat defines meaning.  
> Only when both meet — something *matters*.

---

## How to Start

MyOntologyCode is an idea, not a finished product.

Here’s how to explore it:

- **Read**: Explore the ideas in this README and in the code.  
- **Think**: Ask yourself if Zaat, Human, and other concepts make sense to you (in OOP).  
- **Dream**: Use it to model your own worldview — or channel a philosopher’s.  
- **Change**: Add your ideas. Fork it. Break it. Remix it.
